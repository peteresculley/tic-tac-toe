start with boiler plate code using command
    - npx create-react-app everreal-tic-tac-toe --typescript
    - npx express-generator-typescript everreal-tic-tac-toe-backend

total time spent: ~20 hours (~4 hours each day this week)

notes:
- Normally, I wouldn't include .env in the git repo, but there's nothing private here, and the project can be started right away if I include the .env files
- I seperated the front-end and back-end so that they can be run on different servers, and also so that each can be evaluated seperately.

TODO:
- Types are not right on Dispatch, AsyncDispatch, ThunkDispatch. This is a minor problem because Dispatch is quite standard and clearly marked. I'm saving this headache for after bigger things are finished.
